# vagrant-docker_hosts
Experiments with setting up docker hosts provisioned with ansible.

I'm messing around with Docker and Ansible. This project is a playground for setting up Docker hosts provisioned with Ansible.
I'm using Vagrant to start up a number of virtual machines that are all then provisioned using Ansible.
